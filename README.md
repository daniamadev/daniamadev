## Daniela Amadeu | Data Analyst
_Introduction_

I'm a Brazilian data analyst. My main goal in this place is to show what I know, what I've been studying, and the knowledge I intend to gain.

There is some alphabet soup below:

- Git for Software Development;
- Self-Service Bi tools for presentation;
- R for Data Science;
- SQL Server but PostgreSQL mainly as an SGBD;
- SQL for querying data;
- Statistics for analytical statistics and analytical thinking.
