## Daniela Amadeu | Data Analyst

I'm a Brazilian data analyst. My main goal in this place is to show what I know, what I've been studying, and the knowledge I intend to gain.

There is some alphabet soup below:

- Git for Software Development;
- Self-Service Bi tools for presentation;
- R for Data Science;
- SQL Server but PostgreSQL mainly as an SGBD;
- SQL for querying data;
- Statistics for analytical statistics and analytical thinking.

You can check my LinkedIn if you want: https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-amadeu/
I use to write random stuff but sometimes you can find something about DA and DS.

I really appreciate DA, however I want to become a data scientist and you can follow my progress here in my github.
