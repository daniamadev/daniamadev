## Daniela Amadeu | Data Analyst
_Introduction_
For the past two years I was dedicated to front-end code and technologies such as React.js, JS, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, SCSS, Wordpress and so on.
But since 2023 I'm fully dedicated to study Data Analysis and its entire enviroment suh as SQL, R, Python, Estatistic; and why not DAX and M language from Power Bi? ðŸ˜„
Currently I've uploading SQL exercises and solutions as well R to study the ETL process.
